#white:you have a thought about something you need to do;
#lightgreen:Start GTD Capture Process;
note right
This can be done via capture-templates,
adding directly to your inbox.org file
or calling snippet templates. Whatever
works for you.
end note
if (Can it be done in <2 minutes?) then (yes)
#hotpink:Just do it!;
stop
else (no)
if (Is the item an appoinment\nor have a due date?) then (yes)
:Assign dates to task\nAssign context tags\nAssign 'NEXTACTION' property\nAssign estimates;
note right
Estimates will be used to
predict how much time any
tasks may take
end note
note left
Context tags will help define your next
action such as @computer @email and will
help your org agenda in later steps to
only show NEXTACTION tasks
end note
#hotpink:Refile to your NEXTACTIONS file immediately;
stop
else (no)
#hotpink:refile to INBOX;
stop

#lightgreen:REVIEW STAGE;
:Review INBOX/SOMEDAY once a day/week (what works for you);
if (Can you commit to next action?) then (yes)
if (Can you delegate the item?) then (yes)
#hotpink:Change TODO state to DELEGATED;
:Assign deadline/date when you expect item to be completed\nAssign :WHO: property;
#hotpink:Refile to NEXTACTIONS file;
stop
else (no)
:Assign date when you plan to work on item\nAssign context tags\nAssign 'NEXTACTION' property\nAssign estimates;
#hotpink:Refile to NEXTACTIONS file;

else (no)
if (Can you action sometime in future?) then (yes)
#hotpink:Refile to SOMEDAY;
stop
else (no)
if (Do you need to keep for future reference?) then (yes)
#hotpink:Refile to REFERENCES;
stop
else (no)
#hotpink:Delete the ITEM;
stop
endif

start
#lightgreen:Start NEXTACTIONS Process;
if (tasks has become stale) then (yes)
:Update 'NEXTACTION' states
re-assign new date to complete task;
note right
Setting logging state to 'note'
in emacs on reschedules will force
you to be honest with yourself
end note
:If repeated attempts fail
Refile to SOMEDAY/REFERENCES;
stop
else (no)
if (is task on-going?) then (yes)
:Keep 'NEXTACTIONS' updated;
:Move dates if needed;
stop
else (no)
#lightgreen:Start new capture process to your notes section;
